# Fun With Befunge

### Background
Befunge is a two-dimensional esoteric programming language invented in 1993 by Chris Pressey with the goal of being as difficult to compile as possible. We will implement a simplified version which only deals with numbers and does not allow programs to self-modify.

A Befunge program is laid out on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each containing one ASCII character representing an instruction. Execution proceeds by means of a pointer which begins at the top-left cell and is initially travelling to the right. As it encounters instructions, they are executed. The pointerâ€™s direction of travel can be modified by using the appropriate instructions. The only data storage available is a single stack which stores integers, this can pushed to and popped from using the relevant instructions.

### Task
Write an interpreter for the following simplified Befunge instruction set:

* `[space]`  No-op
* `0-9` Push value of cell
* `.` Pop one value, output it
* `^` Direction = up
* `v` Direction = down
* `<` Direction = left
* `>` Direction = right
* `?` Direction = random
* `+` Pop two values, add them, push result
* `-` Pop two values, subtract second from first, push result
* `*` Pop two values, multiply them, push result
* `/` Pop two values, divide first by second, push result (round down)
* `_` Pop one value, if 0 direction = right, otherwise direction = left
* `|` Pop one value, if 0 direction = down, otherwise direction = up
* `:` Duplicate top stack value
* `#` Skip next command
* `@` End program

Your program should accept a Befunge program and print the appropriate output. You may define any reasonable structure for the input as long as each cell is represented by a single character. It is an error for the pointer to land outside of the grid.

### Examples

The following examples may help you understand how Befunge works.

Prints "123":
```
1.2.3.@
```

Prints "9":
```
12+3*.@
```

Prints "2"s forever:
```
>2v
^.<
```

Prints "54321":
```
123v
v54<
.>v@
....
>^>^
```

Prints "123321":
```
#v123<
 >......@
```

Prints 1 through 20:
```
>1+:.:v
| -*54<
@
```
