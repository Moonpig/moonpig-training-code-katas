# Tamagotchi
Build a HTTP API which could be used to power a simple tamagotchi-style game, where:

- User's have animals
- Petting animals makes them happy
- Feeding animals makes them less hungry
- Animals start "neutral" on both metrics
- Happiness decreases over time
- Hunger increases over time
- Users can own multiple animals of different types
- Different animal types have metrics which incline/decline at different rates
